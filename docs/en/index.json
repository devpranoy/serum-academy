	"content": "Serum Ecosystem The nodes recently voted in favor of the following proposition, creating an initiative to fund projects building on Serum coordinated by EcoSerum, one of Project Serum\u0026rsquo;s nodes. Furthermore, 2% of all Serum fees will be used to fund new projects through EcoSerum.\nFunding and Tokens If you’re building a new project on Serum, you can coordinate with EcoSerum on the following terms:\n  EcoSerum will have grants available for promising proposals. This will be funded primarily with 2% of all Serum fees. To kick start things, the EcoSerum Project Funding Pool (EPFP) has been seeded with 200,000 locked SRM tokens and 1 locked MegaSerum (MSRM).\n These are (M)SRM tokens that are fully locked until 2021-08-01 and then unlock linearly over the following 6 years.    Any promising project will be eligible for a grant of between 1,000 and 20,000 unlocked SRM tokens to pre-launch.\n  Each project that receives a grant will get a further grant of SRM upon project launch. EcoSerum will decide on the second grant size post-launch depending on the project’s execution, ranging from 5,000 SRM to 100,000 SRM, locked 1-7 years.\n  For some projects general to Solana, there may be an additional 25 SOL granted for every 100 SRM.\n  Each project can choose to implement a fee/revenue model that is integrated into Project Serum. If they do:\n The Serum nodes will help in managing the project and its revenue  Staking - Github Node Setup   There will be an SPL token minted for the project; call it TA. 100% of the revenue/fees/etc. of the project will go to a weekly buy/burn of TA. The project team will be granted 20% of TA tokens; 1% unlocked, 19% with a 1-7 year lock. In the case of a massive/complicated project and/or which does not come from the community’s blueprint, these terms are negotiable with EcoSerum. 1% of TA will be distributed to EcoSerum stakers, pro-rata, 1-7 year lock. The other 79% of TA tokens will be distributed pro-rata to all SRM tokens staked (any SRM can be staked, whether locked or unlocked, and there is no minimum quantity). Unlocked SRM holders will receive unlocked TA; locked SRM holders will receive 1-7 year locked TA. Rather than giving one grant up-front, the locked TA will be distributed over the next 7 years to locked SRM. The nodes will manage the entire process, integrating it into the SRM buy/burns and staking. The nodes will coordinate to help TA get listed on Serum with an IDO (initial dex offering) and supported by major Serum GUIs. The nodes will coordinate to get liquidity providers to support TA markets. The nodes will support it with standard node duties, including cranking, cross-chain support, and more    "

	"content": "Serum Swap is a new AMM on Serum! You can find the source code on Github.\nTry it now at: https://swap.projectserum.com or https://swap.bonfida.com\n How does Serum Swap work? Like typical AMMs, you can join the pools and trade against them. The curve is the standard x*y=k curve.\nSolana based AMMs are fast! Serum Swap takes about 1 second to settle a trade or pool addition/removal, and gas fees are tiny: roughly $0.00002 per trade.\nIs there yield? Yes! Anyone can add yield to any pools.\nBut in addition: there will be 1,000,000 SRM tokens dropped as yield over the next month!\nIn particular:\n  Start time: 2020-10-28 1am HKT\n  End time: 2020-11-25 1am HKT\n  Total airdrop: 1m SRM\n  Time: 20 random times, 50k SRM each time\n  Location: 5k SRM each to the following pools:\n SRM/BTC SRM/ETH SRM/USDT SRM/USDC SRM/SOL SRM/YFI SRM/LINK SRM/SUSHI SRM/FTT SRM/FRONT    Method: SRM will be added directly to the contents of the AMM pool, effectively split between all LP token holders\n Note: this is merely indicative and should there be any difficulties best efforts will be made to do what is reasonably in line with the intention.\n What are the fees? Takers are charged 0.30%. Of that:\n  0.25% goes to the liquidity providers (LPs).\n  0.04% goes to a SRM buy/burn.\n  0.01% goes to the GUI hoster; you can set this in the GUI source code.\n  The 25bp fees are tokens left in the pool\n The 4bp and 1bp fees are transfers of LP tokens\n How do you host a Serum Swap GUI? Serum Swap GUI You will find the official repository of Serum Swap UI here: https://github.com/project-serum/oyster-swap. This provides you with everything you need to start your own Serum Swap GUI.\nOnce you have forked the repository, you can run a local environment by running:\nyarn start Collecting fees Serum Swap allows you to collect fees for the orders made on your GUI. In order to collect the fees, you need to modify the .env file that looks like this:\n# HOST Public Key used for additional swap fees SWAP_HOST_FEE_ADDRESS=\u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Rewired variables to comply with CRA restrictions REACT_APP_SWAP_HOST_FEE_ADDRESS=$SWAP_HOST_FEE_ADDRESS To collect fees enter your address in the .env file.\nSetting your own domain name The package.json file contains a field called homepage, change it to your name domain.\nHosting There are different solutions to host your GUI. You can host it for free on Github Pages or host it on your own server.\nGithub Pages This is the easiest way of hosting and deploying a GUI, you simply have to use the following command to deploy your GUI\nyarn deploy The GUI will then be hosted on the gh-pages branch of your Github repository.\nHosting on your own server Alternatively, you can host your GUI on your own server and use Nginx for instance to serve it. To create the production build run\nyarn build The build will be created in the build folder of the working directory.\nHow safe is this? While it has been tested, it has not been audited. Use at your own risk.\nFurthermore, the GUI you use might not always give clear reasons for error messages. When in doubt, check your max slippage.\nSerum Swap has not been audited. Use at your own risk.\n Serum Swap has a 2mm SRM insurance fund\n Can I change the GUI? Of course! That’s the whole point of DeFi: use this as a building block, compose with it, alter it, host it.\nSee what Bonfida and CCAI have done with Serum DEXes!\nThe Serum Swap UI uses React and Ant Desing UI library. To learn how to customize it, refer to their official guide\n Is the AMM on-chain? Yes! This AMM if fully on-chain and noncustodial.\nRight now you can connect to it using Solana wallets such as Sollet.io or SolFlare.\nIs this the only Serum AMM? No! Already there’s an off-chain AMM, but more \u0026ndash; including Pools \u0026ndash; are coming soon.\n"

	"content": "Create your SOL wallet \u0026amp; Deposit Funds The first step is to create a Sollet.io wallet. Your Sollet.io wallet can be funded with SOL or with ETH that will be converted to SOL using the convert function of Sollet.io.\nOnce you arrive on Sollet.io for the first time you have the possibility to create a new wallet. You will be given seed words, make sure to save them offline somewhere safe. This is the only way you can recover your wallet, don’t lose them!\nOnce you have noted down your seeds, you will have the possibility to add a password to your Sollet.io wallet. Even though this is optional, it is highly recommended for your own security.\nOnce the password is set (or not) you have successfully created your SOL wallet. The next step will be to send SOL to your deposit address. SOL can be bought on several exchanges like Binance, FTX or FTX US.\nNow, let’s add some SOL to our wallet. For this you need to click on Receive. A pop up will appear with your SOL address. Use this address to send SOL from an exchange. (Only send SOL to this address, do not send SPL tokens (e.g. SRM) to this address)\nYou can also fund your wallet with ETH and convert it to SOL. For this, click on the ETH tab and connect to your Metamask wallet.\nNow that you have some SOL in your wallet, you can create another SPL address in your wallet. To add another address click on the + icon in the top right corner. A pop up will appear, you will have the possibility to add a popular SPL token such as: SRM, MSRM, FTT, BTC, ETH, LINK XRP, USDT, USDC. Now that you have added an address you can deposit tokens in different ways:\n  You can deposit ERC20 tokens and convert them to SPL tokens using the convert function of Sollet.io and Metamask (to learn how to convert ERC20 to SPL please refer to the dedicated section below).\n  You can use FTX to deposit tokens (ERC20, XRP, BTC etc) and withdraw from FTX to Sollet.io. FTX will automatically wrap your crypto in an SPL token to be used with the Serum DEX. Please note that to convert wrapped SPL assets back into their native chain, you can deposit into FTX and withdraw the unwrapped assets.\n  You can see that below your SOL address a SRM address appeared. You can use this address to send and receive funds to your Sollet.io wallet.\nIf you would like to add another token that\u0026rsquo;s not on the Popular Token list, you can add it manually by entering the Mint Address of the token.\n.\nConvert ERC20 to SPL tokens Sollet.io allows you to convert ERC20 to SPL and vice versa using your MetaMask Wallet.\nTo do so, click on the token you would like to deposit, once deposit pops open click on the ERC20 Tab\n.\nNow, click on CONNECT TO METAMASK, a MetaMask pop up will open, click on Confirm.\nOnce your wallet is connected enter the amount of ERC20 you would like to convert and click on CONVERT. A MetaMask pop up will open to confirm the transaction and set the gas fees:\n.\nThen wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain\n.\nOnce the transaction is confirmed the funds will be available in your wallet.\nNow we have deposited some tokens in our Sollet.io wallet. Time to do a trade on Serum!\nYou can use the convert function of Sollet.io to deposit ETH and ERC20 tokens to your Sollet.io wallet.\n The Token Address or Mint Address is the contract address of a token i.e the token identifier, do not send tokens to this address.\n The Deposit Address is the address where you deposit a token to.\n "

It’s what happens when you click “Automatically approve transactions from https://dex.projectserum.com” If you do, then: For that session As long as the URL is the same As long as the transaction contents match the expected contents (e.g. a DEX order)   It will not require clicking ‘accept’ This code is in https://github.com/project-serum/sol-wallet-adapter If you want your program to be auto-accepted, submit a PR that adds it! Bonfida, Solong, and others also sometimes connect    Check that you’re using the same conventions as e.g. sollet for e.g. seed phrase and private key\n  Consider composing with existing apps:\n If your app needs liquidity you can trade on a DEX orderbook or swap If your app needs to mint tokens, consider using https://spl-token-ui.com Generally check out https://serum-academy.com/en/built-on-serum/ and https://github.com/project-serum/awesome-serum for ideas and tools    For fees going to SRM governance, you can assign to this address if you want\n  Something about suggesting that you add your project to awesome-serum, serum-academy, built-on-serum, etc. when it’s ready for users\n  "

There are lots of variants and customizability but here are some ideas:\n AMMs that trade on Serum\u0026rsquo;s markets AMMs with more than two components AMMs with easy to customize curves  If you build it to the below specs, it will receive a predetermined bounty instead of the variable one.\nBounty: 75k locked SRM\nSpecs:\n  Parameters must be reasonable\n  Must be functional\n  Must have pool tokens\n  Must be open source\n  Must be able to launch new AMMs with arbitrary SPL tokens\n  Note: A draft of an implementation of AMMs on Solana can be found on the GitHub account of Solana Labs.\nSushi Swap Notes: This is submitted on behalf of EcoSerum, a Serum node. Serum Academy is involved in the development of Serum but has not been involved in the development of Sushi in any way.\nProposal  The Sushi community builds out support for Sushiswap on Solana Sushi rewards are paid to both Ethereum and Solana/Serum based Sushiswap  Proportional to the TLV in each Or alternately fixed to each pool Open to other suggestions as well\u0026ndash;what’s fair?   The Sushi community composes this with the Serum orderbooks  Each Sushi pool has a curve, currently constant-product The pool sends bids/offers into the associated Serum orderbook to simulate that curve This allows the Sushi AMM to share liquidity and volume with the orderbook There are maker rebates on Serum orderbooks that the AMMs would capture; they can also add on their own fees   FTX has a bridge from ERC20 \u0026lt;\u0026gt; SPL (Solana token) Sushi; in the next week, Sollet.io will as well Sushi will also be able to compose with a borrow/lending protocol on Serum to allow the pools to trade on margin, though that’s not necessary for V1 To clarify: Sushi would not be moving off of Etherum in any way; this would be an addition, not a replacement.  Rewards  EcoSerum, a Serum node that helps build out the community, will give the following rewards: 50k SRM for 1+2 1 locked MegaSerum for 1-5  One MegaSerum is 1 million Serum put together This will allow the Sushi community to participate in Serum, run a node, receive yield, benefit from a buy/burn, and receive discounts This will be locked (not sellable or transferable) for 1-7 years: fully locked until Aug 1 2021, and then unlocking linearly over the 6 years after that   These rewards are for the Sushi community, controlled by governance, to do what they want with In addition, 20k SRM for 1+2 and another 10k for 1-5 to the team who builds it  Messaging Application Bounty: Bounty of 25k locked SRM\nBuild an instant messaging app on Solana with the following:\n The app would pass encrypted messages over the network The app would be fully on-chain Build a GUI for people to chat with each other The app could be directly integrated to Serum DEX GUI  Yield Farming A yield farming token that is integrated into an AMM system on Serum.\nHere is an idea of what it could look like:\n  Build a \u0026ldquo;pool\u0026rdquo; which starts at 100 SRM + 100 SOL per pool token. It\u0026rsquo;s just an ETF — you can\u0026rsquo;t actually trade against the pool.\n  The pool automatically does the on-chain AMM-style market making on the Serum SRM/SOL market. Basically this means; a liquidity providing strategy such that, if SRM/SOL goes from price A → B → A, the pool’s valuation will at worst be unchanged. The pool will be fully on-chain and its behavior will be well defined from creation.\n  You can \u0026lsquo;create\u0026rsquo; into the pool by delivering the basket. So at the beginning if you send in 200 SRM + 200 SOL you get 2 SPT (Serum Pool Tokens). If after an hour of trading the pool was 150 SRM + 80 SOL then to create 2 SPT you\u0026rsquo;d deposit 300 SRM + 160 SOL.\n  You can redeem your SPTs for the fractional share of the pool.\n  The pool gets the proceeds of its trading, including maker rebates\n  Each day, 10,000 Dumplings are added to the pool for the first 100 days; then no more Dumplings are created. When a Dumpling contract is first created, 100,000 Dumplings (DUM) are airdropped on all SRM holders to seed liquidity for joining the pool.\n  This means that:\n  If you redeem your SPTs after 5 days and you were half the pool, you\u0026rsquo;d get back your SRM/SOL, and also 25,000 Dumplings. You can trade those on the DUM/USDC market or whatever.\n  If after 5 days you want to join the SRM/SOL MM pool for, say, 100 SRM + 100 SOL, you\u0026rsquo;d have to send in: 100 SRM, 100 SOL, and some DUM (maybe 15,000, depending on how large the pool had been/how many DUM are in 1 SPT).\n  This means that entering the MM pool is gated by buying/owning Dumplings, and you get Dumplings each day for providing liquidity.\nBorrow/Lending If you build it to the below specs, it will receive a predetermined bounty instead of the variable one.\nBounty: maximum (100k locked SRM)\nSpecs:\n  Can be isolated between pairs, or cross between all pairs\n  Must at least include the following SPL tokens: USDT, USDC, BTC, ETH, SOL (or wrapped SOL), SRM, FTT, SUSHI, MSRM, YFI, LINK.\n  Must be seamlessly composable onto trades\n  Parameters must be reasonable\n  Must be functional\n  Fees must be either:\n  Predetermined at the creation of a pool\n  Set via a vote of SRM nodes\n  Set via a vote of the protocol’s token\n  100% of fees paid to BORROW/LENDING token\n Consistent with the general EcoSerum token plan    Must be open source\n  Must be able to launch new books with arbitrary SPL tokens\n  Serum Oracle An on-chain oracle that takes prices from Serum markets, does sophisticated risk and sanity checks on them, and creates a clean price feed that other projects working on Serum can use. Furthermore, once there are on-chain cross-chain bridges, those can be combined with this to create a fully on-chain cross-chain pricing oracle.\nSpecs:\n Takes in arbitrary signals  Can take from multiple sources Combines in a reasonable way   Has reasonable error handling and outlier handling Writes on-chain Some way to charge people for querying it on-chain A built-in way to use Serum orderbooks as an oracle  SPL Name Service Create a table where the mint of a token can submit a name for their token. Also create a table where a token controls governance of the naming. If you create this, EcoSerum will support the token\u0026rsquo;s adoption; you get 20% of them.\nCross-Chain Bridges It would be awesome to have fully on-chain bridges between Solana and as many other chains as possible. Cross-chain bridges would be decentralized. See prospective specs for one on Sollet.io, but there are many other versions!\nExchanges If you are an exchange and want to add Solana, SRM and SPL support please reach out to us.\nNative Metamask Integration Native MetaMask integration for Solana, SRM and SPL tokens. See this introduction to Web3 Plugins for more details\nSecurity Audits Security audits of the following repositories:\n https://github.com/serum-foundation/spl-token-wallet https://github.com/project-serum/sol-wallet-adapter https://github.com/project-serum/serum-dex-ui https://github.com/project-serum/serum-dex  App Store Create a Serum app store that would allow people to navigate to all common Serum apps from a single page. This way everyone would be exposed to everything from: Cryptocurrencies.ai, Bonfida, Coin98,various AMM apps, wallets etc\u0026hellip;\nBounty: 40k\nGUI Improvements Below is a list of GUI improvements that could be developed:\n A tool to validate GUIs against the source code Build support for on-chain triggered orders (stop losses, take profits) into Serum.  See Project Serum GitHub account for the source of Sollet.io and the DEX GUI\nOther projects the Serum community is excited about  Other social networking applications General yield farming Hosting Solana validators and RPC servers for Serum usage Serum app store, or other way to easily collect popular dapps on Solana https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1322232473930137603 Add Serum DEX markets that use aTokens, cTokens, yTokens, etc.; make the UI intuitive; so that it’s like other Serum DEXes except open orders are interest bearing Make the prices look like normal BTC/USDC prices etc. Easy ways to go from e.g. aUSDT_SOL → aUSDT_ETH → USDT_ETH and aUSDT_SOL → USDT_SOL Great info, GUI display, querying, external API, on-chain API, etc. of Serum data:  Dex.projectserum.com Swap.projectserum.com SPL token transfers   Make explorer.solana.com great again  When you go to an address and see a history of transactions, there should be a column for (approximate) time, not just block number If you go to a token mint address, token address, or transaction, you should see a (history of) all SOL and SPL token transfers associated with it Transaction parsing for serum dex and swap.projectserum.com “October 28, 2020 at 24:19:50 China Standard Time” should be 00:19:50 (e.g. https://explorer.solana.com/tx/sYdyGKLWqSEjZkSWMCf3o28giXWyx569FAHbeVc4XFuqgvJ52XQ6TvJMnwdGmM76aS2pkePcymqCPBPvmAZUKYe) Building an API into the explorer so you can easily query things like “total SRM sent to address X from time t1 to time t2” and things like that   Swerve: https://twitter.com/SwerveFinance/status/1320864824042008578  "

This provides you with everything you need to start your own Serum GUI.\nOnce you have forked the repository, you can run a local environment by running:\nyarn start Customizing The Serum DEX UI uses React and Ant Design UI library. To learn how to customize it, refer to their official guide\nCollecting fees Serum allows you to collect 20% of the fees for the orders made on your GUI. In order to collect the fees, you need to modify the .env file that looks like this:\nREACT_APP_USDT_REFERRAL_FEES_ADDRESS=\u0026#39;\u0026#39; REACT_APP_USDC_REFERRAL_FEES_ADDRESS=\u0026#39;\u0026#39; To collect fees enter your USDT SPL and USD SPL addresses, for example:\nREACT_APP_USDT_REFERRAL_FEES_ADDRESS=9EscMUvizE1ThHWuWQgs8siDz4r54yVxhZDub3ihWQAX REACT_APP_USDC_REFERRAL_FEES_ADDRESS=9GiKG99ngtKzhQcNXtHokuhx5gk7ftKfrmKtrybHFNa1 Setting your own domain name The package.json file contains a field called homepage, change it to your name domain.\nHosting There are different solutions to host your GUI. You can host it for free on Github Pages or host it on your own server.\nGithub Pages This is the easiest way of hosting and deploying a GUI, you simply have to use the following command to deploy your GUI\nyarn deploy The GUI will then be hosted on the gh-pages branch of your Github repository.\nHosting on your own server Alternatively, you can host your GUI on your own server and use Nginx for instance to serve it.

Pools are a flexible, fundamental primitive on Serum. Each pool has the following properties:\n A set of assets (SPL tokens) A set of Pool Tokens representing ownership of those assets The ability to create or redeem the pool (optional) admin ability to use the assets in the pool  Pools are a way for a group of users to take collective action.\nWhat are examples of pools?  Pools can act as automated market makers:  Each pool token owner has proportional claims on the assets in the pool The pool’s asset admin key can be a program that uses the assets to provide liquidity on e.g. a Serum DEX orderbook Creations and redemptions allow users to enter and exit the pool   Pools can give yield  Each pool token gives fractional ownership of the pool’s assets, so dropping assets into the pool essentially gives them to the pool token holders   Pools can act as collective investment baskets  The pool can rebalance its assets on e.g. a Serum DEX The pool can rebalance either actively or passively    How do fees work? There are three fees on pool creations and redemptions. When a user U initializes a new pool, they set a fee rate (F).\n F/2.5 is paid to U F/2.5 (min 0.01%) is paid to LQID governance F/5 (min 0.005%) is paid to the GUI host  If you host a Pool GUI, you can set the address you want the F/5 GUI fees paid to.\nWhat are admin keys? When you initiate a pool, you can choose whether or not to use an admin key. If you do, then that address has the ability to:\n Add tokens to the list recognized by the pool Remove tokens to the list recognized by the pool Deposit or withdraw assets from the pool Modify the pool’s fee Pause and unpause pool creations/redemptions  Pools are transparent about whether or not there is an admin key. If not, the pool cannot rebalance; if so, users should be cognizant that the key could allow the pool initiator to size the assets unless it’s a safe on-chain program that doesn’t have that ability.\nAdmin keys are able to be controlled by on-chain programs as well, which can then be transparent about what they will and won’t do.\nWhat is further work that could be done on Pools? Whatever you want! But here are a few known areas for improvement:\n Writing a program to allow a user to initiate a pool with an admin key but have a timelock on any admin actions  Note this also has to ensure that pool redemptions aren’t paused during the timelock period   Writing a program to allow a user to initiate a pool with an admin key with multi-sig control Writing a program to allow a user to initiate a pool where the admin key is an on-chain program that only allows trading on Serum DEX markets. Writing a program to allow a user to initiate a pool where the admin key is an on-chain program that implements a standard AMM via trading on Serum DEX markets. Writing a program that accepts USDC/SOL/SRM and trades it into whatever basket a pool requires for a creation  What is LQID? LQID is the governance token of Pools.\nFees from every creation and redemption are governed by LQID (for airdrops, buy/burns, grants, etc.).\nThere has been no presale of LQID; there is no team or team allocation. 100% of LQID tokens are held by EcoSerum to benefit the Serum ecosystem and SRM token.\nThere are 500,000,000 LQID tokens, and will never be more.\nWhere is the pool program? You can find the on-chain pool program here (with admin key) and here (without admin key). You can find the code here.\n"
